"""Nudge a picture onto the model before Pixel Match paints from it.

The 3D model never matches its picture exactly: the camera fit is a pixel or two off and
about 1% in size, and the model builds some features a little away from where they are
drawn (brows, a smile, a fringe). Painting straight from the picture then puts brows on
the forehead and ink lines beside the bumps they belong to. Two steps, both cautious:

- **Outline fit.** Scale and shift the picture (within a few pixels and ~3%) so its cut-out
  sits on the model's outline as seen by the same camera. Skipped unless the two outlines
  already mostly agree, so a picture with no real cut-out is left alone.
- **Feature matching.** Compare textured patches of the picture with the model's own paint
  seen from the same camera (that paint was made on this geometry, so it lines up with
  it), and move the picture's colours by the small offsets found. Only confident matches
  count: a patch must have detail, match well, and match clearly better than nearby
  positions (a repeating pattern does not). Offsets are spread smoothly, fade to zero away
  from any match, and are capped. Plain dense optical flow was tried and returned junk on
  flat cloth and skin (2026-10-12); do not swap it in.

Sizes are given for a 768-pixel picture and scale with the picture's width.
