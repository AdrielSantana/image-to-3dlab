"""Hugging Face sign-in for the Setup page.

A new user's path is: run the install command, then do everything in the viewer. Signing in
to Hugging Face for the gated models was the one step that still needed a terminal
(`hf auth login`). This checks a pasted token with Hugging Face, saves it where
`hf auth login` would, and says which gated models the account can reach.

The token is never logged, stored anywhere else, or sent back to the page.
